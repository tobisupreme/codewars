# Large Factorials

### Instructions

In mathematics, the factorial of integer `n` is written as `n!`. It is equal to the product of `n` and every integer preceding it. For example: `5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120`

Your mission is simple: write a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the value of `n!`.

You are guaranteed an integer argument. For any values outside the non-negative range, return `null`, `nil` or `None` (return an empty string `""` in C and C++). For non-negative numbers a full length number is expected for example, return `25! = "15511210043330985984000000"` as a string.

### NOTES:

The use of BigInteger or BigNumber functions has been disabled, this requires a complex solution

I have removed the use of require in the javascript language.
